How would computers speak? Well...

Heres an example sentence.
Tyler quietly treads in snow on stage while wearing his flower komono.
Yes, I went to the ICY Tour, how would you tell?

English
Tyler quietly treads in snow while wearing his flower komono.

Spanish (English words)
Tyler treads quietly on the snow on the stage while he wears komono flower of him.

Python
tyler=Tyler()
tyler.tread("snow","quietly") //S V O AV  AV=adverb
tyler.wear(tyler.flowerKomono) //S V P O  P=possesive

Java
private Tyler tyler = new Tyler();
tyler.tread("snow","quietly"); //S V O AV
tyler.wear(tyler.flowerKomono); //S V P O

Looks like code is simaler to english, right? Well, lets dig deeper.
If you get low enough, grammer falls apart.

C++
Tyler tyler = new Tyler();
tyler.tread("snow","quietly"); //S V O AV
tyler.wear(Tyler::komono::flower); //S V P A O   A=adjitave

C
struct Tyler tyler = tylerInit();
tread(tyler,"snow","quietly"); //V S O AV //Hmm, word order changed...
wear(tyler,TylerFlowerKomono); //V S P A O

So we have "tread Tyler snow quietly + wear tyler tyler-komono-flower"
it gets worse if you dig deeper...

6502 Assembly.

TYLER   DF 32
MAIN
        LDA #$TYLER  // V O
        STA TylerInitPerams// V O
        JSR TylerInit // V O
        ...
I give up.

So, in C++ we have S V P A O AV
In C we have       V S P A O AV
English is         S AV V P A O
Spanish is         S V AV O A P
So what is mine?
I'm thinking...    S V AV P A O
So, my word order would be:
Tyler walks quietly through the snow on the stage while he wears his flower komono.
And here is is in old english, just for fun.
On stage Tyler walks through snow; his flower komono, he wears.
And heres the original again:
Tyler quietly treads on stage through snow while he wears his flower komono.

Notice I switched the word order in the English version too? Yeah, English has somewhat free word order.
You can't swap random stuff but you can rearange some words.

Tyler walks quietly through the snow on the stage while he wears his flower komono.
S---- V---- AV----------------------------------- +---- S- V---- O----------------
                                S--- V- O--------                P-- A----- O-----

Just cut down on the prepositional phrases and were done!

Tyler walks quietly through snow on stage while he wears his flower komono.
S---- V---- AV--------------------------- +---- S- V---- O----------------
                            S--- V- O----                P-- A----- O-----

So, the final word order:

Subject, Verb, adverb, possesive, adjitive, object.
Clause, conuunction, cluase.

Syntax DONE!
