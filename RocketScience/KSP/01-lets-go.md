Most of the tutorials you do will be done in sandbox mode but not this one. For these first few
tutorials, I'll walk you through Science mode. Create a new science mode save file and choose a flag you like.
Don't like any of them? Me too! Lets go!

# Up

It seams this *space* agency has had a lot of trouble *getting off of the ground*.

See the huge building in the middle? Yeah they built that whole Vehical Assembly Building without ever even
making a single airplane! Click it.

Wernher or whatever his name is will give you a quick intro to the controlls. I hope... cause I don't want to!

On the far left you see a bunch of blue buttons. These are tabs/folders to keep all your parts organized (even if you only have like, five of em)

You should be in the command pod tab and see the mk1 commmand pod and nothing else. Click it to make your rocket.

Next, go to utilities (at the bottom) and place a mk16 parachute on top.

Go to engines (near the top) and grab the flea engine and put it under the command pod

Now, see the little dot at the bottom left? Click it untill there are three peices. This is the 'radial' option.
It places parts evenly spaced for you to keep the rocket balanced.

Using radial 3, place a mystery goo on the side of the engine (its under science, near the bottom)
That should have placed three of them, all equally spaced.

Go to aerodynamics and put the winglet between teh mystery goo. wings keep rockets stable.

Look at the staging stack on the bottom right. Notice how the engine and parachute will activate at the same time.
Thats not good! Hover over the 0 and click the + next to it to add a new stage and add the parachute to it.
Stages run bottom to top so make sure its in the right order!

Now you're almost ready for launch. At the top left, look for a button with a Kerbal that says 'crew'
Click it. Your parts list is now a list of kerbals and you can choose wich one to take with you.
For larger missions, this dosn't matter, but for early missions, oyu need to take the right kerbal for the job!
But not this time, this can just be whoever.

Click the green button in the top right corner to launch.

Now don't look at the rocket on the screen. Immagine an airplane. This will make it easier to explain controlls.

There are three axies of rotation. Roll is rolling the plane so the wings make a diagonal line. 'Do a barrel roll!'
Pitch is simple too. Immagine the plane taking off. It tilts up. thats pitch. A pitch of 0 is the horison, pitch 90 is
pointing streight up and pitch 127 means you broke somthing. Yaw is the last degree of freedom. Take the plane and turn it to the left.
Thats yaw. In real life, planes never yaw. They roll and let the atmosphere turn them. This is probibly why I have no clue how to explain yaw but
eh, I tried. If you're still confused, search pitch yaw roll and go to images. That will explain it WAY better than I ever could with words.

Ok. To pitch, use W and S. Pitch is inverted so you press S to pitch up and W to pitch down.
To yaw, use A and D, and to roll is Q and E. T will enable SAS, wich will pitch-yaw-roll for you. You can tell it to be
stable, or point to any one of the spesific orbital vectors. What are those? Who cares!

To throttle egines, use Shift and Ctrl. Shift is up, ctrl is down. To set the trottle all the way up or all the way down,
use Z to go up and X to go down. Solid fuel engines, like the one you're using can't be throttled st this won't matter untill later.

Action groups make stuff happen, I'll explain them more later but for now, know that G is landing gear U is lights, B is breaks (you have to hold it down)
and backspace is abort. These action groups are programed by you but for now, they don't matter.

Caps-lock enables percision steering. I don't use it much but I feel like I should.

To time warp, use , to decrese it and . to increse it. For Physics warp, hold down MOD and time warp.

The 'MOD' key is usually the *right* shift key, but it varies from platform to platform. On windows, its left alt and on mac, its option.

Did any of that make scence? No? Good! All you need to know is that WASDQE turns, and T is stability assist.

Lastly, the most important controll, the big red button, or rather, big black/white button. To give it that big red button feel, you use the spacebar to stage.
You should also press space cause you want to go to space. But not yet! Theres "science" to do!

Right click the command pod and click crew report. Press the green button to save. Hover over your Kerbals picture in the corener and
click EVA.

Right click the command pod and click 'take data'. Right click the kerbal and click EVA report, then surface sample. Then press B to get back inside.

You're probibly thinking, a surface sample of the *launch pad*?? an EVA report from he pad and looking at the mystery goo and watching it do *nothing*??
This isn't science! And you're right, but the R&D department dosn't even know they're part of a space program! So all of this is context for them.
Why do they not know? Cause they're Kerbals! Thats my little reason why all of this "science" gets you so far. Oh, and by the way, you can technically
complete the entire game just by running exteriments in different bioms in Kerbin. You can beat the entire game without ever going to space. How boring!
The science system is unbalanced but thats alright. Just make sure to do lots of different missions to keep it interesting

Right click another mystery goo but don't observe it, just keep it open.

Press space to launch!!

Tap D while flying to tip east. I'd say, to about the 70 degree marker.
