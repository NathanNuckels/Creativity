Original creation

Phoenix was a human that lives with Canary, the main antagonist. Phoenix got
accidently phased out over time. Phoenix didnt want to be involved with the
characters problems but did found them interesting. Phoenix's apperance is never
described.

Stellius Update

To add Phoenix into Stellius, he had to be completely overhauled. His personality
is the same original consept. He dosn't know whats going on most of the time
and dosn't want to get involved with the main plot, he just likes to watch.
As for his apperance, the art style is based off of the way CrizBN draws 
humans[1][2] and his exact pperance is based off of the author's apperance IRL.


Post TF

After a lengthy period of minor ajustments, he was finally happy with his new
form. He really loves his new form but always reverts to human when visiting
his home world. He wishes he could show all of his friends who he truely is
but he does enjoy keeping his family out of the loop.

Trivia
  - Since Phoenix symbolizes the author, Phoenix's voice is actually the author's 
  natural voice.
  - The hoodie Phoenix wears is a real hoodie that the author wears all the time.
  - At one point in the show, someone says his outfit is like a cartoon character
  and he takes it as a complement. This is a reference to TheOdd1sOut always wearing
  solid color V neck T shirts in high school, landing him the same "complement"
  - When asked what the name Phoenix ment, Alan said "In retrospect, I'll say that
  Phoenix is going to help me rize from the ashes. In the moment, I didn't know
  why, I just kinda went with it"
