STELLIUS WIKI: characters/Zipline.txt


Zipline (Usually known as Phoenix[1]) is a blue usually[2] metalic airplane draggon
with a pastel blue underbelly, and a dark blue tail with fins on the top and
sides. His brown eyes are on a screen, like a Synth but sometimes glow cyan.
The leading edge of his wings glow cyan. To make it easier to move arround,
he can remove his wings[3][4].

More recent updates to Zipline are adding cloths[5]. As he is heavily inspired by
CrizBN[6], he decided to copy off of Criz's sweater and give it to Zipline.
Zipline also has a red collar[2] with a bell on it. This is possibly a reference to
Vitti, one of Alan's old friends. He claims it has many untold secrets but the
main one if he puts it on as Phoenix, he becomes Zipline (Without his wings.)
In the show, it is unclear how Zipline reverts into Phoenix but the author has
mentioned it happens automatically when he returns to his home world[7].

Zipline's antlers/antenna are based off of the KDE Draggon's antlers.
