NYMPHERIUS SKLEAN


Nympherius comes from an old character, 'Nepharius Nymph' from an imporv experiment
beck in 7th grade art class. It was (ironicly) a tall man shrouded (literally) in darkness
with red accsents, like BLurryface. I, out of the blue, decided to reincarnate this character
by combining the two words into...

Nympherius Is, I guess the 'trama' character of the bunch.
They are the connection from Stellius, to the Fudalism album. Namley, they are defined in the literall interpretation
of "Water"

| I get no compensation for my skrewed up occuption
| Caught me workin' nine to nine in the night time suspended in my fright

| I gotta keep my self near a little overworked here
| And now I'm gettin clobbered and pulled out of my water...

Figurativly it is a cry for work reform. Literally, it is someone gettig taken from their homeland.
In the music video (Not the Daft Punk version) There is an avali getting dragged out of a lake.

Quick side note, there is a sign in the background that says "Fish out of water; 72 hours".
72 hours is the length of a work week.

Unlike some other characters in MVs, Nympherius actually interacts with the rest of Stellius.


Nympherius Sklean (Nymph + Nepherius and Skew + Lean) is a light desat transulcent green anphibous avalii
with purple accents. The fethers on the leaves are translucent lime desat green and the bone part is purple
and very shiny. Their eyes are a night sky, dark blue with white specs and [TODO]. Their tail is [TODO]

As you can tell, thy are extreemly hard to draw, not only all the fethers individually but also
all the gradients and on top of that, they are often near water and that refracts light and and scatters blue light and---
Well, you get it. Its complicated. Best left to 3D animation for now.
