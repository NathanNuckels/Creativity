\verb|AAAA| is an insterstellar address. 003C is our planet. This must have been
sent to ground control. FFFF is Earth and 12A is\ldots{} Is this the dreaded 
flight 12A? 298 in human numbers, its the first crewed mission, and its not 
going well.

Are they really handing it over to me? I don't want to deal with this! I suppose
they want \textit{me} to decypher the messages.

\sourcecodepro{You may not talk to the crew because they are 
!translation-error!}

''To the translator system, can you at least try to translate it word for word?``

\sourcecodepro{Sure! Your langualge and our language use different grammer so
word for word might help you.} --- \sourcecodepro{The crew 
!translation-error! has been, therefore, you the crew talk able not}

Thats a bit hard to understand, given its in the raw english word order but I
notice it said they 'have been` and since we can't talk to them, they must
'still be`.

''Can you describe it?``

\sourcecodepro{Its classified.}

Of course it is.

''Looking through what you've said to other people, not dead, not drugged, not
sucked into space, not incapasitated in any way\ldots{} They sound like they are
all in perfect health to me so why can't they talk to us?``

\sourcecodepro{They are !translation-error! and there is no crew.}

''What happened to the crew?``

\sourcecodepro{This is an un-manned mission. Just me and my modules.}

''But I heared that there were humans``

\sourcecodepro{Yes. The ship carries cargo of roughly 200 humans.}

These human AIs are so underdeveloped\ldots{} not that we can do any better.
I am actually an AI but I'm sentient and therefore 'not a machine` and I live 
just like everyone else. We are all Protogens here. The problem is we can't make
a NOT sentient AI. Its either too cumbersome to work with, or too smart and they
start demanding rights. We just can't make anything in the middle. We tried
using one of our dumb AIs to handle this for us but it ended up playing a game
agenst the human's AI called 'chess` and our system lost?? I really don't get
the details but thats what the reports say\ldots

''Can you eject the cargo?``
